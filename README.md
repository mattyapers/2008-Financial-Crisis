## Introduction
As part of my data analysis portfolio, I collected historical data on bank stocks during the 2008 financial crisis using the Alpha Vantage API. The crisis had a profound impact on the banking sector, with many major financial institutions facing bankruptcy or insolvency. The collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 triggered a wave of panic across global financial markets, leading to a sharp decline in stock prices and widespread economic disruption.

## Data Collection

```python
import pandas_datareader.data as web
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import datetime as dt
import os
%matplotlib inline
```
To retrieve historical data, I will be using 'pandas_datareader'. With this library, I can easily extract financial data from various sources, including Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, and the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
